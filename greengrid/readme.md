# Abstract

The Green Grid is an ambitious project to create a shared high performance computing infrastructure for science and engineering at Dartmouth College. The Green Grid was created with the support of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts & Sciences to promote collaborative computing for the entire Dartmouth community. We will share our design for building campus grids and experiences in Grid-enabling applications from several academic departments.
